  What is the project?
The ITTI Smart Town App is a community-focused mobile application created for small towns with limited infrastructure and public transport. ITTI currently has only one school bus running at fixed times, making mobility and access to services difficult for residents. This app acts as a digital assistant for the town, combining navigation, fitness, local information, and smart transportation tools in one place.


  Why does it exist?
Limited public transportation.
Lack of centralized local information.
Need for healthier at-home lifestyles.
Inefficient taxi usage due to unoptimized routes.


  Target audience
Residents of ITTI.
Local taxi drivers.
Visitors to the town.
Municipal or community organizers.
