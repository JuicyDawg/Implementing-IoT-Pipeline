  WHAT IS THE PROJECT?

The ITTI Smart Town App is a mobile application designed for small towns with limited infrastructure and public transport. The Town of ITTI currently has only one school bus operating at fixed times, which makes mobility and access to services difficult. The application acts as a digital assistant by combining navigation, fitness, local information, and smart transportation tools in one place.

WHY DOES IT EXIST?

Limited public transportation
Lack of centralized local information
Limited access to gyms or sports facilities
Inefficient taxi usage due to unoptimized routes

TARGET AUDIENCE

Residents of ITTI
Local taxi drivers
Visitors to the town
Municipal or community organizers
