  WHAT IS THE PROJECT?

The ITTI Smart Town App is a mobile application designed for small towns with limited infrastructure and public transport. The Town of ITTI currently has only one school bus operating at fixed times, which makes mobility and access to services difficult. The application acts as a digital assistant by combining navigation, fitness, local information, and smart transportation tools in one place.

TECH STACK


Frontend

HTML – used to structure the user interface
CSS – used for styling and layout
JavaScript – used to handle basic logic and interaction with the backend
The frontend is kept simple to ensure clarity and ease of understanding. It communicates with the backend using HTTP requests.

Backend
Node.js – JavaScript runtime used to run the server
Express.js – lightweight framework used to create API routes
The backend provides basic REST API endpoints that return data related to the town, such as places, bus routes, and activities.
